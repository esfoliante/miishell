# Miishell

## About the project

Based on the famous "minishell" that is developed by [42 students](www.42porto.com), this project aims to create a simple simple version of a shell developed in C.

This project is simply to learn, and may contain some security issues with it (and really, it doesn't have as many features as you need to daily drive it).

> Some of the code used here is heavily based on the code in this repository https://github.com/brenns10/lsh, so it's natural you find some similarities.

## Background

I've always had a special interest in C / low level programming, and specially when it comes to things that are so "obscure" such as kernels, shells, system libraries... and when my friends did it, I had to give it a try as well.

Usually students are prepared, little by little, to develop this big project, creating libraries one by one, but I decided to go all in and try to recreate the shell using my previous knowledge and some online tutorials.

## The future

This is still a work in progress, so some changes may be introduced from one day to another.

The next big step is to port miishell to Rust, one of the programming languages I'm most comfortable with.
